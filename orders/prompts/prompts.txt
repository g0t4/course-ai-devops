## generating web.yaml

/Users/wesdemos/repos/github/g0t4/course-ai-devops/orders

Hey I have a web app that uses docker compose for dev, I need to get it running in minikube instead. Just a single web app with a deployment and service. Nothing vestigial. 

--- 

can you save those files to disk for me in an "infra" directory, put the deployment and service into a single manifest called web.yaml
